# Stock Prediction and Analysis Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Stock Prediction and Analysis Project! This comprehensive application combines cutting-edge technologies and powerful libraries to provide an in-depth analysis of stock data. Leveraging Streamlit, yfinance, Prophet, Plotly, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and textblob, this project offers a sophisticated user experience for understanding historical trends, making predictions, and exploring sentiment analysis.

## Features
